## Research Paper Directions
- Based on the code and the output of code i give you write a very detailed academic research paper
- use as much data as possible throughout the report from the code + output
- format all output very nicely for a financial academic paper (including tables, charts, etc. and knowing which numbers to format a certain way given the context)
- change any ref to "Sharpe Ratio" to "Return Per Unit Of Risk"
- dont have numbered strategies just their names
- also include specific strategy logic in detail as well as the code snippets used to generate them
